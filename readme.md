# Advanced React & GraphQL

This repository is my learning of the [Advanced React & GraphQL](https://AdvancedReact.com) course by [Wes Bos](https://WesBos.com/).
Changes have been made in line with the latest advances and updates to the dependencies to keep up to date as much as possible.

## Getting Help

The best place to get help is in the link above of the course website.

## FAQ

**Note:** Unlike Wes Bos, I use Sublime Text with plugins to get it to work as close as to Wes' Visual Code with his extensions are listed on [his dotfiles repo](https://github.com/wesbos/dotfiles).

I use [ESLint for Sublime Text](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/ESLint) and [JsPrettier](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/JsPrettier) for JavaScript formatting.
